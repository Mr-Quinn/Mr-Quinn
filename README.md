- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mr-Quinn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all .arr apps to support my personal Plex Libraries.
I utilize 2 Synology NAS for movies (radarr) & tv shows / music library, Sonarr & Lidarr. A reconfigured AS6706T running TrueNAS SCALE for a few of the other essential apps.
Tailscale is the best for me to have secure access. With this I have cut cable/sat service completely.
